# SE2TeC
## A Scalable engine for Efficient and Expressive Time series Classification

<center>By Jingwei ZUO, Karine ZEITOUNI and Yehia TAHER.</center>

## Outline:

The instrodcution of the file structure inside the project

### 1. Cluster_Docker

We provide an 1-click Spark cluster, powered by Docker, which contains the support of PySpark and relative Python3 libraries. Users can modify flexibly the number of slave nodes inside the cluster, and simulate the enviroment locally. 

### 2. Algorithms

We implement all algorithms mentioned in the Paper under Python3.6, which can be distinguished by Centralized Version and Distributed Version. 

### 3. Video Cluster   

In order to show the efficiency and the scalabity of SE2TeC, we give a exploration of our cluster by a video, where the attendees can get deeper understanding about the distribution mecanism adopted inside our algorithm, as well as the relationship between the cluster capacity and the performance of the program. 

### 4. GUI - Shapelet Extraction

There are four parts in GUI demonstration for Shapelet Extraction:  

- Distance Profile  
- Matrix Profile   
- Representative Profile/Power  
- Discriminative Profile/Power
